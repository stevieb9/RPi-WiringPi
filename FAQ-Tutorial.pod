=head1 SETUP

=head2 System configuration

If you want to avoid using your system installed Perl installation to use this
software (or you want to use interrupts), you should do some pre-configuration
of your system. Note that the system installed Perl does not use threads, which
is required for interrupts to function.

As your normal, every day user, install L<perlbrew|http://perlbrew.pl>, Then
install an instance of Perl, and switch to it:

    perlbrew install perl-5.24.0
    perlbrew switch perl-5.24.0

To use C<sudo> to run your scripts within the appropriate Perl
installation, you need to modify the C</etc/sudoers> file. Prepend the string
value for the C<secure_path> directive to include the path to the new
C<perlbrew> managed perl, followed by a colon. For example:
C</home/pi/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.24.0/bin:>. Leave the existing part of
the string in place.

Now, you can do everything with the normal user account, using their personal
installation of Perl, and you just need C<sudo> to run your scripts, leaving
your default system installation intact.

=head1 PI 

=head2 Create a Raspberry Pi object

The first thing you need to do is call the C<setup()> method. We do
that automatically. See L<new()|RPi::WiringPi/"new-args">. We use the GPIO pin
numbering scheme.

    my $pi = RPi::WiringPi->new;

=head2 Board revision

The board revision is the same as the GPIO pin layout on the board:

    my $revision = $pi->gpio_layout;

=head1 PIN 

=head2 Creating and using a GPIO pin object

The L<RPi::WiringPi::Pin> class provides you with objects that directly map to
the Raspberry Pi's onboard GPIO pins. You generate a pin object through the
main C<$pi> object we created above.

    my $pin = $pi->pin(27);

    # set the mode to output, presumably to power an external device

    $pin->mode(OUTPUT);

    # by default, pins are set to LOW (ie. 0 voltage). Turn it on...

    $pin->write(HIGH);

    # get the current status of a pin (HIGH or LOW)

    my $state = $pin->read;

    # get a pin's pin number

    my $num = $pin->num;

=head2 Internal pull up/down resistor

All GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi have built-in pull up/down resistors to
prevent pins being in a "floating" state when not connected to either ground or
power. This is very important in many situations, particularly when using
interrupts.

    # HIGH when not in use

    $pin->pull(PUD_UP);

    # LOW when not in use

    $pin->pull(PUD_DOWN);

=head2 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

Pulse Width Modulation kind of acts like a potentiometer (or a variable
switch... like a light dimmer). They are used to send pulses of electricity
to a device across time. It is required for things like stepper motors, or
dimming an LED. Note that only physical pin C<12> on the Raspberry Pi has
hardware-based PWM (GPIO #18).

    # set the pin to PWM_OUT mode. Must be physical pin 12

    $pin->mode(PWM_OUT);

    # values are 0-1023 which represent 0% to 100% power

    $pin->pwm(512); # pin output is ~50%

    # make pin go from off to bright gradually...
    # requires Time::HiRes qw(usleep);

    my $pin = $pi->pin(18);
    $pin->mode(PWM_OUT);

    for (0..1023){
        $pin->pwm($_);
        usleep 50000;
    }

=head2 Interrupt usage

Built in is the ability to have Perl code you define executed when a pin's edge
changes (a pin goes from LOW to HIGH or vice-versa). This code acts as an
interrupt handler. The Interrupt Service Request that listens for the change
runs in a separate C thread than your application.

Interrupts are useful in many cases, but think of a button; you want an action
to happen when someone presses a physical button on your prototype, but you
obviously want to be doing other things while waiting for that button press.

    # set an interrupt handler for when the pin goes from
    # LOW to HIGH. The second parameter is the string name
    # of the Perl subroutine at the bottom of this example

    $pin->interrupt_set(EDGE_RISING, 'handler');

    # HIGH to LOW

    $pin->interrupt_set(EDGE_FALLING, 'handler');

    # HIGH and LOW (handler will be called on both changes)

    $pin->interrupt_set(EDGE_BOTH, 'handler');

    sub handler {
        print "in handler\n";
        # do other stuff, perhaps turning on/off other pins
    }

=head1 INTERRUPTS

Although we've already used interrupts from within a pin object, you can use
them separately as well.

=head2 Configuring

    my $interrupt = $pi->interrupt;

    # set an EDGE_RISING interrupt on pin 27

    # callback is the string name of your handler
    # subroutine that'll be called when an interrupt
    # has occurred

    $interrupt->set(27, EDGE_RISING, 'callback');

    sub callback {
        ...
    }

=head1 SERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (SPI) BUS

=head2 Set up and communication

Allows you to write to and read from devices attached to the SPI bus, using the
external L<RPi::SPI> distribution. Please refer to that documentation for full
usage instructions.

    # generate a new SPI object

    my $channel = 0; # /dev/spidev0.0

    my $spi = $pi->spi($channel);

    my $buf = [0x01, 0x02];
    my $len = 2;

    # write the two bytes in the buffer to channel /dev/spidev0.0

    $spi->rw($buf, $len);

    # do a read-only call. Send in the number of bytes you want back as dummy
    # bytes (ie. 0)

    my $dummy = [0x00, 0x00, 0x00];

    my @read_buf = $spi->rw($dummy, 3);

=head1 ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTERS (ADC)

=head2 Initialization and reading input

We provide access to both the ADS1x15 and MCP3008 ADCs.

The default is to return an ADS1115 object from L<RPi::ADC::ADS>. Please review
that documentation for full usage instructions.

    # fetch a new ADC object

    my $adc = $pi->adc;

    # fetch the voltage level on pin A0 on the ADC

    my $v = $adc->volts(0);

    # fetch the percentage of input on pin A0

    my $p = $adc->percent(0);

You can also request an MCP300x ADC from L<RPi::ADC::MCP3008>. Again, for full
details, see that documentation.

    my $adc = $pi->adc(model => 'MCP3008', channel => 0);

    my $raw = $adc->raw(0);
    my $percent = $adc->percent(0);

=head1 DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTERS (DAC)

=head2 Configuration, initialization and setting analog output levels

This functionality is brought in from L<RPi::DAC::MCP4922>. Please refer to that
documentation for full configuration and usage instructions.

    # prepare and fetch a new DAC object

    my $dac_cs_pin = $pi->pin(29);
    my $spi_chan = 0;

    my $dac = $pi->dac(
        model   => 'MCP4922',
        channel => $spi_chan,
        cs      => $dac_cs_pin
    );

    my ($dacA, $dacB) = (0, 0);

    $dac->set($dacA, 4095); # 100% output
    $dac->set($dacB, 0);    # 0% output

=head1 DIGITAL POTENTIOMETERS

=head2 Initialization and usage

This functionality is brought in from L<RPi::DigiPot::MCP4XXXX>. Please refer to
that documentation for full usage instructions.

    my $cs = 18;     # GPIO pin connected to dpot CS pin
    my $channel = 0; # SPI channel /dev/spidev0.0

    my $dpot = $pi->dpot($cs, $channel);

    # set to 50% output

    $dpot->set(127);

    # shutdown (sleep) the potentiometer

    $dpot->shutdown;

=head1 SHIFT REGISTERS

=head2 Overview

This software has the capability to utilize 74HC595 shift registers.

Each register contains 8 digital outputs, and four can be daisy-chained
together for a total of 32 extra output pins.

Each register (or chain of registers) require only three GPIO pins.

=head2 Usage

We'll get right into the code:

    # the new register pins will start at GPIO 100.
    # this can be any number outside of existing GPIO

    my $base = 100;
    
    # the number of pins on the register(s) you plan on
    # using. Maximum eight per register

    my $num_pins = 8;

    # the GPIO pin number that the register's DS pin (14)
    # is connected to

    my $data = 5;

    # the GPIO pin number that the register's SHCP pin (11)
    # is connected to. This is the register's clock

    my $clk = 6;

    # the GPIO pin number that the register's STCP pin (12)
    # is connected to. This is the register's latch pin

    my $latch = 13;

    # initialize the register

    $pi->shift_register($base, $num_pins, $data, $clk, $latch);

    # now you have full access to the register's eight outputs
    # through standard methods

    for (100..107){
        my $pin = $pi->pin($_);
        $pin->write(HIGH);
    }

=head1 LCD TOUCH SCREENS

Typical 16-pin, 2-4 row and 16-20 column LCD screens work here. You can use
4-bit or 8-bit mode (4-bit requires 6 GPIO pins, 8-bit requires 10). If you
need a higher rate of data transmission to the LCD, use 8-bit mode. Typically,
4-bit has always worked perfectly for me.

=head2 Initialize

Before an LCD can be used, it must be initialized. This may look like a lot,
but you only need to do it once. Essentially, you're configuring all pins up
front.

NOTE: When in 4-bit mode, although you're setting C<d0> through C<d3> pins
up and leaving C<d4> through C<d7> as C<0>, the wiring must connect to LCD pins
C<d4> through C<d7>. Look at LCD pin 4-7 as LCD pin 0-3 when in 4-bit mode.

    my $lcd = $pi->lcd;

    my %lcd_args = (
        rows  => 2,     # number of display rows, 2 or 4
        cols  => 16,    # number of display columns 16 or 20
        bits  => 4,     # data width in bits, 4 or 8
        rs    => 1,     # GPIO pin for the LCD RS pin
        strb  => 2,     # GPIO pin for the LCD strobe (E) pin
        d0    => 3,     #
        ...             # d0-d3 GPIO pinout numbers
        d3    => 6,     #
        d4    => 7,     # set d4-d7 to all 0 (zero) if in 4-bit mode
        ...             # otherwise, set them to their respective
        d7    => 11     # GPIO pins
    );

    $lcd->init(%lcd_args);

=head2 Display operations

Now that we've initialized the LCD, we're ready to use it.

    # turn the display on/off. It's on by default

    $lcd->display(ON);  # or OFF

    # put the cursor at col 0, row 0

    $lcd->home;

    # clear the display and move cursor to home

    $lcd->clear;

=head2 Cursor operations

    # move the cursor to a position

    $lcd->position(0, 0);   # col 0 (first slot), row 0 (top row)
    $lcd->position(0, 1);   # col 0 (first slot), row 1 (bottom row on 2 row LCD)
    $lcd->positon(5, 1);    # col 5 (6th slot), row 1

    # turn on/off cursor (on by default)

    $lcd->cursor(OFF);  # or ON

    # make the cursor blink (off by default)

    $lcd->cursor_blink(ON); # or OFF

=head2 Output operations

By default, output starts at col 0 and row 0 of the display. Use C<position()>
to move it around before outputting.

    # print out a string

    $lcd->print("My name is stevieb");

=head2 Putting it all together

Here's a trivial script that outputs information to specific LCD positions
(we'll start right after an LCD C<init()>).

    my $perl_ver = '5.24.0';
    my $name = 'stevieb';

    $lcd->home;

    $lcd->print("${name}'s RPi, on");
    $lcd->position(0, 1);
    $lcd->print("Perl $perl_ver...");

=head1 BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SENSORS

There's support for the BMP085 and BMP180 barometric pressure and altimiter
sensors, which also include a temperature sensor. This functionality is
provided by the L<RPi::BMP180> distribution.

=head2 Usage

A full use-case example of using the barometric/temperature sensor:

    my $pin_base = 200; # any number higher than the highest GPIO

    my $bmp = $pi->bmp($pin_base);

    my $f = $bmp->temp;
    my $c = $bmp->temp('c');
    my $p = $bmp->pressure; # kPa

=head1 HYGROMETER SENSORS

We provide access to the C<DHT11> temperature/humidity sensors through the
L<RPi::DHT11> distribution.

=head2 Usage

    my $sensor_pin = 21;

    my $env = $pi->hygrometer($sensor_pin);

    my $humidity  = $env->humidity;
    my $temp      = $env->temp; # celcius
    my $farenheit = $env->temp('f');

=head1 UTIL LIBRARY

=head2 Overview

The included L<RPi::WiringPi::Util> module contains a few helper-type methods
for internal and external use. Most of these you won't need, but others are
very helpful when writing your own scripts that go beyond trivial.

You can transform pin numbers from one scheme to another, get full pin number
maps/translation hashes, manually export and unexport GPIO pins etc.

It's worth having a look at...

=head1 RUNNING TESTS

First off, please review the C<t/README> file for the GPIO pins we use for the
test physical configuration, and set up the Pi according to the
L<unit test diagram|https://stevieb9.github.io/rpi-wiringpi/breadboard/brewbuild_test_platform_bb.jpg>.

Before running the tests, you need to set a special environment variable so that
we know we're on a Pi board. This ensures CPAN testers won't run the tests
across all of its platforms:

    export RPI_BOARD=1

There are a couple of test files that require root privileges, but we handle
this internally by re-running the file with C<sudo> enabled. This allows all
tests but these couple to be run as a standard user.
